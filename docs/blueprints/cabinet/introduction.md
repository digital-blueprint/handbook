# Introduction

*cabinet* is a student records management application, developed to assist registrar's offices or other university units responsible for the handling of students' data and documents. As one of our *digital blueprint* bundles, *cabinet* interacts with other components to enable a set of useful functionalities in electronic student records:

- manual document upload from the personal computer or directly from the cloud
- PDF/A validation via the *verity* bundle
- automatic transfer of externally created documents via the *CAMPUSonline DMS connector*
- automatic transfer of persons data from CAMPUSonline via the *Relay API Gateway*
- manual metadata enrichment
- document and data storage via the *blob* bundle
- presentation of documents and data in the user interface
- combinable text search and facetted search across personal and document data
- signing documents electronically via *eSign*
- hybrid postal delivery of documents via *dispatch*
- document and data download
- document and data deletion

The following chapters give more detailed information about the application, its components and the implementation into your own system landscape.

If you are a technician interested in implementing *cabinet* into your system, it's best to read all chapters starting from here, as well as the ones that will be referenced in the texts.

If you are a user of the *cabinet* application, then you might want to skip the technical chapters and go directly to the [User manual](./user-manual.md) chapter.
