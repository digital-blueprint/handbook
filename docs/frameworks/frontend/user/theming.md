# Theming and individualizing your application

**Basic Knowledge:** CSS, HTML

**Recommended Knowledge**: [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"}, [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/de/){:target="_blank"} (or similar)


You can adapt the **[fonts](#fonts)**, the **[colors](#color-system)**, and some **parts** in the form of [slots](#slots).
Moreover, you can also change favicons and browser specific items ([Favicons, Search Engine and more](#favicons-search-engine-and-more)).

DBP also supports multiple themes. To create multiple themes look in the [readme](https://github.com/digital-blueprint/toolkit/tree/main/packages/theme-switcher#usage-in-an-application-with-appshell){:target="_blank"} of the theme-switcher web component.

## Fonts
You can apply a font by adding the font-family to the `html` or `body` in a css `<style>` tag.

If you want to apply multiple fonts for multiple themes then add the `font-family` property to the appropriate css class.

### Self-hosted fonts
You can host your fonts locally and import them in the `<style>` tag of the `index.html`.
Then you can apply it to the style with adding the `font-family` to body, html or a specific theme.

For example:

```html
 <style>
    @import "<%= getPrivateUrl('fonts/nunito-sans/300.css') %>";
    @import "<%= getPrivateUrl('fonts/nunito-sans/300-italic.css') %>";
    @import "<%= getPrivateUrl('fonts/nunito-sans/700.css') %>";
    @import "<%= getPrivateUrl('fonts/nunito-sans/700-italic.css') %>";


    body {
        font-family: 'Nunito Sans', 'Calibri', 'Arial', 'sans-serif';
        line-height: 1.4em;
        font-weight: 400;
        }
</style>
```

### External Fonts

You can also import external fonts, e.g. Google fonts, by adding the import statement in the `<head>` tag of `ìndex.html`
an embedding the font in the `font-family` css part, as described above. (Take care and eventual update your **data protection** site)

For example:

```html
<head>
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
    <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:wght@100&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

    <style>
        html {
            font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
        }
    </style>
</head>


```

* If this doesn't work out of the box, check the CSP settings in the `.htaccess`.

### Font weights
We use the css property font-weight with the relative weight values lighter and bolder.
So be carefully with the initial font weight. Take a look at this documentation about relative font weight at [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight#meaning_of_relative_weights){:target="_blank"}.


## Color System

To make the colors as customizable as possible, there is a dbp color system.

You can override the default colors for customize your app. For universities, these colors should have a contrast level of at least AA in contrast to the base color.
You can read more about the minimal contrast level in [Accessibility](../dev/accessibility.md#minimal-contrast-level).

All colors without a postfix need to work on top of the "base" color. All others need to work on top of their respective surface colors.

The default oft these colors would be always the dbp colors.

<b>*</b> These attributes are required, if you have more than one theme or a dark theme.

**Note:** Default colors will be used in case of undeclared variables. Colors don't have to be different in all cases, for example the primary color can be the same as the accent color.

### Adapting the colors
You can override a css variable inside a selector by taking the variable and assign it to a new value.

```css
.any-selector {
    --dbp-override-background: green;
}
```

You can change the color-system in two ways: with multiple themes or only within one theme.
If you only want to use one theme you can override the variables in css inside the html selector.

```css
html {
    --dbp-override-background: black;
}
```
If you want to override variables in multiple themes read the [readme](https://github.com/digital-blueprint/toolkit/tree/main/packages/theme-switcher#usage-in-an-application-with-appshell){:target="_blank"} of the theme-switcher web component.

### Usage of these colors
In some cases you may have to use these variables (e.g. slot css). You can use these variables in css by surrounding them with a `var()` function.

E.g.:
```css
.any-selector {
    background-color: var(--dbp-override-background);
}
```

Further information about CSS variables in general can be found at [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties){:target="_blank"}.

## Icons
In digital blueprint frontends you can also change icons. (E.g. if you have your own icon set or want to change specific icons).

The icon override work similar to the color override - with css variables.
To override an icon you have to write in a css selector the prefix `--dbp-override-icon-` + the icon name.
You can find the icon name of a specific icon with the site-inspector, e.g. from [mozilla firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector){:target="_blank"}  or the [chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/){:target="_blank"}.
You can also take a look at the [icon vendor](https://github.com/digital-blueprint/toolkit/tree/main/packages/common/assets/icons){:target="_blank"} in the toolkit repository.

Now you can override any icon with that css variable. Simply pass the new icon with its relative path to the css variable with `url()`.

Example:
```css
.html {
    --dbp-override-icon-iconname: url("pathto/newicon.svg");
}
```

The new icon should be type of **svg**.

Further information about CSS variables in general can be found at [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties){:target="_blank"}.

You can change these icons for all themes or only for one theme.
If you want to override variables in multiple themes read the [readme](https://github.com/digital-blueprint/toolkit/tree/main/packages/theme-switcher#usage-in-an-application-with-appshell){:target="_blank"} of the theme-switcher web component.


## Overriding default translations
!!! warning "Currently in development"

    This feature is currently in development, thus not everything may work as explained here. Translation overrides are not yet supported in the main versions of the apps!

You can override the default translations provided by us in your application at spots that subscribe to the `lang-dir` attribute.
To override the default translations, a few things have to be done.

 * The spot where you want to insert your translation has to support overrides. Thus, it has to subscribe to the `lang-dir` attribute. This should be the case for most components.
 * You have to know which key you want to override. To see the translation keys, you can use the frontend debug mode. This is done by appending `#debug` at the end of the webpage and reloading the page. Then all text that uses translation keys gets replaced by the translation key.
 * You need to write a translation file with your override translations. This is done in `json` format. Since [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) is used as a translation engine, please have a look at the [i18n json documation](https://www.i18next.com/misc/json-format). You will have to provide a `translation.json` file for each language you want to translate your page into.
 * The translation file has to be located in a defined directory. By default, the translation directory is in `assets/translations/`. Each language needs its own directory with only one file inside which has to be named `translation.json`. Thus, if you want a german and a english translation, you will need the files `assets/translations/de/translation.json` and `assets/translations/en/translation.json`. Currently, only english and german are supported.
 * Translation override files containing all keys and all default translations are already present in the given location. You can simply change the given translations and insert your translations.

 If you want to add new translations and extend the webpage, please have a look at the [translation developer guide](../dev/translations.md).

### Example
Consider the following scenario:

You want to replace the text in a save button. By default, the button shows the text `Save` but you want to change it to `Submit`. The website in debug mode shows you the key `dbp-create-3g-ticket.save-btn`. This means that the button text is provided by the activity object namespace `dbp-create-3g-ticket` which contains the key `save-btn`. An example override translation file (for english) could look something like this:
```json
{
  ...
  "dbp-create-3g-ticket": {
    ...
    "save-btn": "Save",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
To change the translation, you just need to change the value associated with the key.
```json
{
  ...
  "dbp-create-3g-ticket": {
    ...
    "save-btn": "Submit",
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Customizing the application with slots
You can use various slots to customize your application. You can place your custom assets like images or customized texts inside of slots to adapt the appearance of the application as you want.  

### App shell slots

<figure id="fig1" style="width:100%;">
    <img src="../assets/ui_images/DBP-UI-Design_page_02.svg" alt="App shell Slots" style="width:100%; border: 1px solid black;">
    <figcaption>
        <b>Fig. 1: App shell slots visualization</b>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<figure id="fig2">
    <img src="../assets/ui_images/DBP-UI-Design_page_05.svg" alt="App shell Slots mobile" style="width:100%; border: 1px solid black; margin: auto;">
    <figcaption>
        <b>Fig. 2: App shell slots mobile visualization</b>
    </figcaption>
</figure>

You can adapt the **name**, **title**, **logo** or exchange the whole **header**, the **footer-links**
or exchange the whole **footer**. [[Fig. 1]](#fig1) [[Fig. 2]](#fig2)
The nearer description can be found in the documentation of the [app shell](https://github.com/digital-blueprint/toolkit/tree/main/packages/app-shell){:target="_blank"}.

You should place these slots in the `<template id= "global-override">` tag of your `index.html`.

For example, you can override the name in the top left corner, and the logo shown in the top right corner:

```html
<template id="global-override">
    <template id="dbp-greenlight">
        <div slot="name">
            MyUni<br />
            <dbp-translated subscribe="lang">
                <div slot="de">
                    Meine Universität
                </div>
                <div slot="en">
                    My University
                </div>
            </dbp-translated>
        </div>
        <div slot="logo">
            <img style="height: 80px" src="path/to/logo.svg" alt="My university logo">
        </div>
    </template>
</template>

```


### App specific Slots
Often there are app-specific slots or rather, activity-specific slots. These slots are often used for text customization.
In the activity description, in the `src` folder of the application you can read which slots are available.

You should place these slots in the `<template id= "global-override">` tag of your `index.html`.

For example:

```html
<template id="global-override">
    <dbp-acquire-3g-ticket lang="de">
        <template slot="description">
            <dbp-translated subscribe="lang">
                <div slot="de">
                    Erstellt ein Ticket für den Zugang zu Räumlichkeiten der TU Graz.
                </div>
                <div slot="en">
                    Creates a ticket for access to premise of TU Graz.
                </div>
            </dbp-translated>
        </template>
    </dbp-acquire-3g-ticket>
</template>

```

## Favicons, Search Engine and more

### Favicons
#### Replace favicons & PWA icon
If you want to change the favicons and PWA icons you have to simply replace the content of their files. We have generated all favicons or app icon sizes for supported browsers.
To change the favicons you have to replace the files in *images* directory. Don't rename them! They should have the same name and the same size as the default files.
You can use the free & open source Image editor [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"} for resizing and exporting your favicon.

##### How to resize your logo with GIMP
1. Open you logo as svg with 300dpi and a large resolution in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/){:target="_blank"}.
2. Clip your layer to the logo: `layer -> Clip to content`
3. Crop the image to the layer: `ìmage -> fit canvas to layer`
4. Change canvas size to a square: `image -> canvassize ->` change the canvas size to a square, add a small padding and click `center` and `change size`
5. Scale the image to the recommended size: `image -> scale image` choose the size you want
6. Export the image with the correct name `file -> export to` select standards and export it
7. Replace the old favicon file with your favicon file

#### Use the dbp favicon and app-icon with your brand colors
If you don't want to create an own PWA icon or an own favicon, we provided the possibility to simple change the colors of the digital blueprint favicon/app icon to your brand colors.
For that you have to edit the [whitelabel app icon](https://gitlab.tugraz.at/dbp/dbp-ci/-/tree/main/favicon_appicon/app_icons/whitelabel){:target="_blank"} (which you need) and the [whitelabel favicon](https://gitlab.tugraz.at/dbp/dbp-ci/-/tree/main/favicon_appicon/favicon/whitelabel){:target="_blank"}. You can find the im the [dbp Corporate Identity](https://gitlab.tugraz.at/dbp/dbp-ci){:target="_blank"} gitlab repository.
You can use the free & open source vector based image editor [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/de/){:target="_blank"} for editing your icons.

##### How to change the colors of the icon
The following steps has to be done for the whitelabel favicon and the whitelabel app icon.
You can read [here](../../../cd/apps.md#favicons-of-apps) which resolutions and formats are used by the two files.

1. Open the needed svg whitelabel icon file in [InkScape](https://inkscape.org/de/){:target="_blank"}
2. Double-click on the first square, then a line in the middle of the square should appear: the gradient line
3. Right-click on the square and open the window "fill and outline", now you can see the gradient with two colors
4. In the window(fill and outline -> fill) you can choose one point on the gradient by clicking on it. then you can change the color of it. Make your color changes in the first square
5. Repeat these steps for the other squares
6. Save the file

For creating the right resolution take a look at the section [How to resize your logo with GIMP](#how-to-resize-your-logo-with-gimp) above.


### Preview
You also can change the name and description of each application to change the preview of it on some browsers or devices.(e.g. google preview and search engine, mobile preview, PWA's)

In the **index.html**:

- Adapt the `<meta property="og:site_name" content="">` with your site title in the `content` attribute.
- Adapt the `<meta property="og:url" content="" />`with your site url  in the `content` attribute.
- Adapt the `<meta title="">`, `<meta property="og:title" content="">` with your application title in the `title` and `content` attribute.
- Adapt the `<meta title="">`, `<meta property="og:title" content="">` with your application title in the `title` and `content` attribute.
- Adapt the `<meta name="description" content="">`, ` <meta property="og:description content="">` with your application title in the `title` and `content` attribute.


In the **app.manifest.json**:

- Adapt the `"name": ""` (max. of 45 characters)  with a human-readable name of your application.
  - It is the primary identifier of the app and displayed everytime the name of the application is shown and enough space is given.
- Adapt the `"short_name": ""` (max. of 12 characters recommended) with a short version of the human-readable name of your application.
  - It is a short version of the app's name and is displayed where not enough space for the full name, such as: app launcher, new tab page in chrome

For more information about the app.manifest.json you can read under [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/Manifest){:target="_blank"}.


### Not for using the activities embedded

To ensure a uniform and responsive design activities should occupy 100% width of the window when the activities width are under 768 px.
