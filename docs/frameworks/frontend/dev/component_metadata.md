# Component Metadata

Topics and activities both have accompanying metadata files that describe them.
This metadata is used to display information about the component without loading
the actual JavaScript file. It also allows for searching and filtering
components based on their metadata.

## Topics

A topic is a collection of activities which are in some way related (e.g. all
activities that provide functionality for the library system). A topic can have
a name, a description, a routing ID, and it defines a set of attributes which
can be synced between the contained activities and saved/restored between runs.

### Example

```json
{
  "name": {
    "de": "Elektronisches Signaturservice",
    "en": "Electronic Signatures"
  },
  "short_name": {
    "de": "Signaturservice",
    "en": "Signature Service"
  },
  "description": {
    "de": "Mit dieser Applikation k√∂nnen Sie PDF-Dokumente signieren",
    "en": "With this application you can sign PDF documents"
  },
  "routing_name": "signature",
  "activities": [
    {"path": "dbp-official-signature-pdf-upload.metadata.json",
     "visible": true},
    {"path": "dbp-qualified-signature-pdf-upload.metadata.json"},
    {"path": "dbp-signature-verification.metadata.json",
     "visible": true},
    {"path": "dbp-signature-verification-full.metadata.json",
     "visible": true}
  ],
  "attributes": []
}
```

* `name`: The long name of the topic
* `short_name`: The short name of a topic, used in places where limited space is a concern.
* `description`: Description of the topic.
* `routing_name`: A URL-safe identifier that can be used for routing. Should be unique.
* `activities`: A list of activities.
  * `path`: Path to an activity metadata file relative to the location of this file.
  * `visible`: Wether the activity should be visible.
    (to hide unfinished activities for production for example)
* `attributes`: A set of attributes that all activities in this topic can share.
  This means when switching activities these attributes can be forwarded to the next
  activity, or in case the page is related these attributes can be restored.

## Activities

An activity is a special web component that is self contained, can be embedded
in another page and follows some simple rules, like it registers a fixed HTML
tag for itself.

### Example

```json
{
  "element": "dbp-official-signature-pdf-upload",
  "module_src": "dbp-official-signature-pdf-upload.js",
  "routing_name": "official-pdf-upload",
  "name": {
    "de": "Dokumente amtssignieren",
    "en": "Officially sign"
  },
  "short_name": {
    "de": "Dokumente amtssignieren",
    "en": "Officially sign"
  },
  "description": {
    "de": "Erlaubt das Hochladen von PDF-Dokumenten, um sie mit einer Amtssignatur zu versehen",
    "en": "Allows upload of PDF-documents to officially sign them"
  }
}
```

* `element`: The HTML tag name that this activity is registered under
* `module_src`: The javascript file to load for `element` to be available
* `routing_name`: An URL-safe value used for routing. Should be unique.
* `name`: The name of the activity.
* `short_name`: The short name of a activity, used in places where limited space is a concern.
* `description`: Description of the activity.
